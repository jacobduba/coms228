# Lecture 02

**Abstract data type**: collection of payload + collection of operations on the
payload

*Abstract* means we do not how HOW something is accomplished, because it is
hidden by the OOP paradigm

**ADT**: small, very powerful engines for data processing

Exercise: first iteration of ISU student ID system
```java
// 9 digit integers
public interface ISUID {
	void add(int studentID);
	boolean contains(int studentID);
	int size();
}
```

We're going to implement a a naive implementation. Naive can be GOOD because it
is cheap to write. It may underperform or be ineffient, but it does the job and
we did not have to think hard, because it was a chjeap solution.

```java
public class SortedID implements ISUID {
	private int[] ids;
	private int size;

	public int getSize() { return size; }
	
	public boolean contains(int studentID) {
		// Use the structure present in the sorted numbers to execure a binary
		// search, which executes in logn steps, where n is the number of
		// elements. 
		// log is inverse exponentiation
		// log of 1000 is 10
		// log of 1000000 is 20
		// log of 1000000000 is 30
	}

	public void add(int studentID) {
		// 1. find add location with binary search in logn steps
		// 2. Make a hole where the element should be added and shift ALL 
		// elmenents to 
	}
}

public class UnsortedID implements ISUID {
	private int[] ids;
	private in size;
	// Constant time method because it only takes a few unchanging computer
	// operations
	public int getSize() { return size; }
	// constant-time method (superfast or instant execution)
	public void add (studentID) {
		ids[getSize()] = studentID;
	}
	// linear-time method: takes as many steps as the number of payloads in my
	// data structure. Relatively expensive find
	public boolean contains(studentID) {
		// loop through all indices up to size() excluded and check if
		studentID is equal to any element.
	}
}
```

#### Unsorted ID (optimized for frequent adds):
`add()` - instant

`size()` - instant

`contains()` - linear

#### Sorted ID (optimized for frequent searches):
`add()` - linear

`size()` - instant

`contains()` - logarithmic
