## Splay Trees

A flavor of self-balancing Binary Search Trees that guarantee height of the tree will be $O(logn)$.
They do this by always performing a "splay" operation after an add, delete, or search.

The splay operation promotes the current node of interest all the way to become the new root!

This is not too expensive because any promotion to root takes at least $O(logn)$ steps.
So reagrrangin the tree EVERY time costs: 

* $O(logn)$ to find the node + $O(1)$ to add or delete if necessary.
* + $O(logn)$ to promote node
