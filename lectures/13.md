## Selection sort + comparators

For the exam, you will need to know how to write a selection sort and insertion sort.
Merge sort and quick sort (thank god) will not be on Exam 1.

```java
public static void selectionSort(int[] arr) {
	for (i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; ++i) {
		int minIndex = 1;
		for (int j = i + 1; j < arr.length; ++j) {
			if (arr[j].compareTo(arr[minIndex])) {
				minIndex = j;
			}
		}
		int temp = arr[i];
		arr[i] = arr[minIndex];
		arr[minIndex] = temp;
	}
}
```

To use compareTo(), we implement Comparable<MyClass>:

```java
public class MyClass implements Comparable<MyClass> {
	@Overide
	public int compareto(MyClass other) {
		return this.salary - other.getSalary();
	}
}
```

But... how do we compare complex objects? E.g. Employee on salary and years of service.

We use the Comparator interface which implements a compare():

```java
public class LengthComparator implements Comparator<String> {
	public int compare(String lhs, String rhs) {
		return lhs.length() - rhs.length();
	}
}
```

Now let's use it!

```java
public static void selectionSort(int[] arr, Comparator<String> comp) {
	for (i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; ++i) {
		int minIndex = 1;
		for (int j = i + 1; j < arr.length; ++j) {
			if (arr[j].compare(arr[j], arr[minIndex]) < 0) {
				minIndex = j;
			}
		}
		int temp = arr[i];
		arr[i] = arr[minIndex];
		arr[minIndex] = temp;
	}
}

selectionSort(arr, new LengthComparator());
```

For Employee objects:

```java
public class SalaryComparator implements Comparator<Employee> {
	@Override
	public int compare(Employee lhs, Employee rhs) {
		return lhs.getSalary() - rhs.getSalary();
	}
}

Employee[] arr = new Employee[11];
selectionSort(arr, new SalaryComparator);

// You can have multiple Comparators, but only one compareTo()
public class TenureComparator implements Comparator<Employee> {
	@Override
	public int compare(Employee lhs, Employee rhs) {
		return lhs.yearsOfService() - rhs.yearsOfService();
	}
}
```

Rule of thumb:

We can use Comparable to make an object contain its natural ordering â€” e.g. alphabetical order for Strings.
The object itself implements Comparable.
By contrast, complex objects may have additional criteria of ordering.
(Example: Stars havea natural order in terms of class "K-class, B-class, etc.")
To compare on additional criteria, we use Comparator. 

## Insertion Sort

**AGAIN**, you will need to be able to write this for the exam. On paper. Yeah.

Intuition: push elements to the left, towards index 0 as long as they are smaller than preceding elements.

```
n = A.length
for (i = 1; i < n; i++)
	temp = A[i]
	j = i - 1
	while j > - 1 && A[j] > temp
		A[j+1] = A[j]
		--j
	A[j+1] = temp
```

Big-O of the above code:

Worst case scenario is reverse-sorted array.
Then each element will travel to index 0.
The average travel will be n/2 indices in the inner loop.
The outer loop is n steps, for a total time of n*n/2 = O(n^2)

Selection sort vs Insertion sort

- Both are O(n^2)
- **BUT** Insertion sort is super-fast on nearly-sorted data because it rarely enters the inner loop for a best case-execution of O(n)
	- Nearly sorted data is often encountered in the real world.

Algorithm Type - recursive

0. Termination condition
1. Examine the call history when determining Big-O;
multiply steps-per-call by the number of calls.

Merge Sort is known as a LAXY algorithm, which is high praise for algorithms and means the algorithm does not complete work at any given step and/or attempts to defer work until it no longer matters.

Algorithm sudo-code:

```
MERGESORT: (A)
	n = A.length
	if n <= 1 return
	m = n / 2
	B = [A_0........A_M]
	C = [A_m+1........A_n-1]
	B = MERGESORT(B)
	C = MERGESORT(C)
	A = MERGE(B, C)
	return A
```

Merge() Intuition: run two loops in lockstep, one for each array half, and place ach smallest element in the third combined array.
If one half-array is exhausted, append the other half-array.
