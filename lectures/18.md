## Collection

An interface for the most primitive array-equivalent possibible, which does not require indexing.

You want a data structure?
These are the methods you need.
Every ADT is a collection!

* `boolean add(E item)`
* `int size()`
* `boolean contains(Object obj)`
* `boolean remove(Object obj)`
* `Iterator<E> iterator()`

### Iterator


A class that know how to traverse and return ALL objects in a collection-derived class.
Iterators come in different flavors (with more and more functionality).
This is the simplest one.

* `boolean hasNext()` Allows terminating the traversal.
The job of the iterator is to serve every element exactly once.
* `E next()` produces and item, e.g. a red pen.
* `void remove()` ONLY deletes an item previously served by NEXT

The only way to use it:
```
next() remove() next() remove() next remove()

next() remove() remove() -- the 2nd will throw an exception
```

`remove()` is only allowed to delete a served element because if it DIDN'T it would be able to traverse the collection by deleting it. This is called a side effect.

### Example

```java
Collection<String> c = new ArrayList<String>();
c.add("A");
c.add("B");
c.add("C");

Iterator<String> iter = c.iterator();

while (iter.hasNext()) {
	String s = iter.next();
	System.out.println(s);
}

// FOREACH loops. Any container that returns an iterator can be iterated through
// with a FOREACH loop, which is SIMPLIER than a for loop.

for (String s : c) {
	System.out.println(s);
}

// String s is the receptacle for processing; 
// it gets filled repeatedly with the next element in the collection.
```

### Writing our own collection

Now, let's make our own FirstCollection (Array-based Collection).
It's not as fancy as ArrayList, but still using the same principals.

```java
public class FirstCollection<E> extends AbstractCollection<E> {
	private static final int DEFAULT_SIZE = 10;
	private E[] data;
	private int size;

	public FirstCollection() {
		this(DEFAULT_SIZE);
	}

	public FirstCollection(int initialCapacity) {
		data = (E[]) new Object[initialCapcity];
		size = 0;
	}

	@Override
	public boolean add(E item) {
		checkCapacity(); // double array size if needed
		data[size] = item;
		size++;
		return true;
	}

	@Override
	private void checkCapacity() {
		if (size == data.length) {
			// Create a copy of the data array with double the capcity.
			data = Arrays.copyOf(data, data.length * 2);
		}
	}

	// MyIterator is a private INNER class residing inside FirstCollection:
	private class MyIterator ... {
		public E next();
		public boolean hasNext();
		public E remove();
	}
	// The above setup allows the iterator class to see all private members.
	// When served to the client, the Iterator class will allow next(), hasNext(), and remove().
}
```

`checkCapicity` Big-O: is it linear?

Answer: it is amortized-constant time!

Adding 1 element takes O(1) operations.
Every time we double the array, we copy all existing elements.
The total number of elements we copied to insert n elements is n - 1.
THe total number of instructions to insert n elements are: n insertions & n - 1 copies.
For O(n) to insert n or O(1) to insert 1 element.
Insertion may be slow occasionally, but it is perfectly efficient in the long run.
This is called "amortized-constant time."
