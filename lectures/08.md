### Method 3: `Clone()`

Method comes from `Object.clone()` that is hard to invoke.
Needs 4 steps to allow us to use it.

Java decision for default clone is clunky. 
It is a chore compared to copy constructor.
You need to know it because it is used by code in real world.

```java
// Clone() for a Point object
public class Point implements Cloneable { // step 1a: implement clonable
	@Override
	public Object clone() { // step 2: overide clone
		Point copy = null;
		try {
			// Java calls a low-level method from the operating system to copy
			// a region in memory bit-by-bit.
			// This will copy all instance variables verbatim. Primitive
			// variables will copied correctly but object variables will NOT
			// be copied correctly. The current Point object is copied correctly
			// because it only contains primitive instance variables.
			copy = (Point) super.clone(); // step 3: call super.clone()
		} catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) { // step 4: include a try-catch{} statement
			// If this statement is missing or "implments Cloneable" is missing,
			// will throw this CloneNotSupported Exception and cause problems.
		}
		return copy;
	}
}
```

#### Shallow vs deep copy

`IntVector`: `int Point` in several dimensions, e.g. 3

```java
@Override
public Object /* Or any descendant, e.g. IntVector */ clone() {
	IntVector copy = null;
	try {
		copy = (IntVector) super.clone();
		coords = new int[dim]; // make a new array of correct size;
		for (int i = 0; i < dim; i++) {
			coords[i] = existing.coords[i];
		}
	} catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {
			
	}
	return copy;
}
```

Four rules for overriding methods:

1. You can change the return type to a descendant, e.g. Object->IntVector
2. You CANNOT change method name or any parameters
3. You can make the access more permissive protected-public BUT NOT more restrictive (public->private)
4. You cannot add new exceptions BUT you can omit exceptions that are already thrown by the ancestor

## Static variables and methods

**Static members** HAVE NOTHING TO DO with static typing (members == variables and methods)

**Static typing** means that every variable memory location has a class or primitive associated with it

Static variables and methods are part of the class defiintion and ARE NOT associated with any particular object in memory.
They exist regardless of whether objects exist in memory.

Static member means "There is only ONE copy in memory and all objects share it."

```java
// Simple class Person that only knows its name and the number of persons in existance.
class Person {
	public static int numberOfPeople; // shared between all person objects!
	public String name;
	public Person(String name) {
		this.name = name;
		numberOfPeople++;
	}
}
```

After making 3 `new Person("Joe")`, `new Person("Jane")`, `new Person("Jill")`,
all of them have the same value in `numberOfPeople`: 3.

Static varialbes are created at PROGRAM START and are technically part of the class definition,
so they do not care about how many objects (or none) there are!

Avoid the following code smell:
```java
Person myPerson = new Person(...);
myPerson.numberOfPeople; // Works but is a terrible idea because it obscures the fact that number of people is static.
```

Static variables == class variables (synonyms)
