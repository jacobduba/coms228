Primative variable equality is tested with `==`

Object variable equality is tested ith with `.equals()`, because `==` for object
references answers the question: "Is this the same object in memory?"

`if (r == q)` is not particulary useful for if statements.

What we want is "conceptual" equality, and we have to code it ourselves in Java.

`Object.equals()` exists, but it does not do much: returns true if the two
objects are the same object in memory (the == functionality). The existence of
the default `equals()` implementation will help us with writing our own by
giving us a hint of how to construct it.

**EXAM1 Writing an `equals()` is a garenteed 10 to 15 point question on the next
exam:**
```java
// Steps to writing a correct equals() method

// 1. Include @Override to prevent typo-related method signature bugs.

// Object.equals() has set up an extremely helpful signature: the parameter is
// type Object which means we accept any and all classes as parameters.
// If the parameter was a point, calling equals on two references a.equals(b)
// that you youare not intimately familiar with will result in a error for
// incompatible types. We do NOT want the program to stop executing; so we
// accept Object as the parameter and all classes that are descendants on it.

// 2. Set the parameter to be of type Object.
@Override
Point class equals(Object obj) {
	//3. Check if obj is null and return false if it is.
	if (obj == null || obj.getClass() != this.getClass()) {
		// 4. addutuibakky check the runtime type of the objects, and if 
		// diverging reutrn false.
		return false;
	}

	// 5. Downcast Object to my class of interest, here Point in order to access
	// it's member variables. We store the cast into a new reference so we do
	// not have to cast anymore.
	Point other = (Point) obj
	// 6. Compare the values of all instance variables.
	return x == other.x && y == other.y;
	// 7. Return the result.
}

// ASIDE: having more than one command included on the same line is code smell:
// a potiential source of future bugs. When reading the code at a future date,
// there is a change one or more of the commands are ignored or misinterpreted
// by the human reader. The alternative? Always declare a result varialbe and
// evaluate it; then return the result variable on the last line.

// ASIDE: Object.getClass() works correctly and will tell what the runtime
// object at a reference is. Also, on the Internet you can see people using obj
// instance of this, but it is an incorrect practice instanceof does not mean
// equality, it means "equal or decendant", which is not reciprocal.
```

### Practice

```java
// 1 override annotation
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) { // 2 object parameter
	// 3 check for null 4 check class equaivalence
	if(o == null | o.getClass() != this.getClass()) {
		return false; // return fa;se if either fail
	}
	// up to here we handle all non-conforming objects or empty objects.
	// 5 downcast from Object to the object of interest, Bee
	Bee b = (Bee) obj;
	// 6 Compare instance variables one by one
	// 7 return the result.
	
} // When the comparison is between custom classes, we have to check if they are
// null, we have to check if they are the same object in memory, and if they are
// notm we have to call their own equals() methods. Writing an equals() method
// for a complex object is recursive because we have to write equals() methods
// for the contained objects.
```

## Access Modifiers in Java

* **Public**: everyone can see the member (variable or method)
* **Private**: nobody but the owner class can see the member
* (default): everyone in the package can see the member
* **Protected**: everyone in the package can 

## Copying and cloning

1. `Point makeCopy(Point p)` Custom method
2. `Point(Point p)` Copy constrcutor
3. `clone()` Hurdles set up by Java to prevent misuse

#### Method 1: copying a Point

```java
public Point makeCopy(Point p) {
	Point result = new Point(p.getX(), p.getY());
	return result;
}
```

#### Method 2: Copy constructor

```java
Point(Point other) {
	x = other.getX();
	y = other.getY();
}
```
