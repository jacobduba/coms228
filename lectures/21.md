## The AbstractSequentialList Class

Implementing the full `List` intreface would be overwhelming.
Instead, we build upon the existing abstract class `AbstractSequentialList` where all other methods other than `size()` and `listIterator(pos)` are optional.

## A Doubly-Linked List Implementation

Singly-linked lists are a poor choice for implementing the list interface,
because it isn't easy to iterate backwards on them.
Therefor, we focus instead on a doubly-linked list implementation of the `List` interface;
it is called `DoublyLinkedList`.

Our lists will have dummy nodes at the head and tail.

```java
public class DoublyLinkedList<E> extends AbstractSequentialList<E> {
  private Node head;
  private Node tail;
  private int size;
}
```

We can use the same `Node` class as in `DoublyLinkedCollection`.
The constructor is:

```java
public DoublyLinkedList() {
  head = new Node(null);
  tail = new Node(null);
  head.next = tail;
  tail.previous = head;
  size = 0;
}
```

We will need a few helper methods.
The first of them splices agiven node a specified position in the list.

```java
/**
* Inserts newNode into this list after current without updating size.
*/
private void link(Node current, Node newNode) {
  newNode.previous = current;
  newNode.next = current.next;
  current.next.previous = newNode;
  current.next = newNode;
}
```

The next method removes a specified node from the list.

```java
/**
* Removes current from list without updating size.
*/
private void unlink(Node current) {
  current.previous.next = current.next;
  current.next.previous = current.previous;
}
```

The last helper method returns a reference to anode at a specific position in the list.

```java
/**
* Returns the Node whose index is pos, which will be head is pos == -1
* and tail if pos == size.
*/
private Node findNodeByIndex(int pos) {
  if (pos == -1) return head;
  if (pos == size) return tail;

  Node current = head.next;
  int count = 0;
  while (count < pos) {
    current = current.next;
    ++count;
  }
  return current;
}
```

**Time complexities of the helper methods.**
It is not hard to see that `link()` and `unlink()` are $O(1)$ time operations,
while `findNodeByIndex()` takes $O(n)$ time in the worst case, where n is the length of the list.

`add()`. We have two options when adding an element.
The first just adds a new element at the end of the list.

```java
public boolean add(E item) {
  Node temp = new Node(item);
  link(tail.previous, temp);
  ++size;
  return true;
}
```

The second adds the item at a specific position.

```java
public void add(int pos, E item) {
  if (pos < 0 || pos > size)
    throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("" + pos);
  Node temp = new Node(item);
  Node predecessor = findNodeByIndex(pos - 1);
  link(predecessor, temp);
  ++size;
}
```

**Time complexities of the add() methods.**
The `add(item)` takes $O(1)$ time, since we have direct access to the end of the list.
On the other hand, `add(pos,item)` takes $O(n) time in the worst case —
where, as uaul n is the length of the list —
since we have to traverse the list (using `findNodeByIndex`) to locate the insertion point.

### List Iterators

As usual, we implement iterators with an inner class, here called `DoublyLinkedIterator`.
We give two options.

```java
public ListIterator<E> listIterator() {
  return new DoublyLinkedIterator();
}

public ListIterator<E> listIterator(int pos) {
  return new DoublyLinkedIterator(pos);
}
```
The class declaration begins like this:

```java
private class DoublyLinkedIterator implements ListIterator<E> {
  // direction for remove() and set()
  private static final int BEHIND = -1;
  private static final int AHEAD = 1;
  private static final int NONE = 0;

  private Node cursor;
  private int index;
  private int direction;
}
```

We need to provide two constructors.

```java
public DoublyLinkedIterator(int pos) {
  if (pos < 0 || pos > size)
    throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("" + pos);
  cursor = findNodeByIndex(pos);
  index = pos;
  direction = NONE;
}
```

Next time, we will how to implement the `ListIterator` methods.
