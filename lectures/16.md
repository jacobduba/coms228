## Generics

Inheritance in Java interacts with Generics. 
Both are complex features and we need to know how the interact.

Because of the million lines of legacy code, in Java 6 Generics were introduced at the compiler level only.

Client code does not care or worry about types!
The generic method with inspect the past objects and infer the class based on the entoured object.
So we can call the generic selection sort above with just `selectionSort(arr, new ToyataYearComparison);`

The only effort with generic methods is during method definition;
calls of generic methods use normal Java.

Any label can be used in the angle brackets. Some convetions:

* T is Type
* E is Element
* K is Key
* V is Value e.g. LinkedHashMap<K, V>

```java
public static <T> void selectionSort(T[] arr, Comparator<? super T> comp) {
	for (int i = 0; i < arr.length;i)
}
```

Let's go over that first time, what's that super mean?

```java
Comparator<? super T> instead of Comparator<T>
```

We basically "horse-wisper" to the compiler "take comparator for any ancestor of the T class."

If old comparators are outdated, then the original declared.

### Attempt 1:

```java
public static <T> void selectionSort(T[] arr) {
	// Throws Compiler error: method compareTo() undefined for type T.
}
```

Translated to English: "You told me to take any class BUT you expect the class to have a custom method. So you don't actually take my class."

### Attempt 2:
```java
public static <T extends Comparable<T>> void selectionSort(T[] arr) {
	// This is OK, because compareTo() is now known to the Compiler.
}
```
