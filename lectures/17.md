## Type Erasure

Basically, the compiler level understands generics but the runtime does not.

```java
ArrayList<String> a1 = new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList<String> a2 = new ArrayList<>()

a1.add("Hello");
a2.add(new Bee(3, "Gold", "OrangeTree"));

System.out.println(a1.get(0)); // Decompile SOP((String) a1.get(0))
System.out.println(a2.get(0).getChass()); // Decompile SOP((Bee) a2.get(0)...)
// Prints true, because the runtime only sees a list of objects.
// There are no symbols for generics in the class files.
System.out.println(a1.getClass() == a2.getClass());
```

In practical terms, Java's implementation of Generics is not that bad, but it does limit us a bit.
There's a limitation with how to play with T variables.
It needs to be known at runtime it doesn't work.

```java
T myVar = new T(); // Not possible
T[] myArr = new T[]; // Not possible
x instanceOf T; // Not possible
```

All of the variables in this example are an instance of Object.

Here's a useful situation for Generics:

```java
E[] data = (E[]) new Object[50];
```

> An exam question on Generics is unlikely!

## Custom Data Structures

1. First question — why bother?
Arrays are very "low-performance."
2. Solution — more and more complex data structures!
	* We will use the Java Hierachy to build a better array.

Alright, let's get started!

### Collections

Grandfather of all abstract data types.
Collections should be as primitive as possible so we can add sophistication through inheritance.

This data structure is kind of like a real world Leather Pouch.
An array provides indexing, sequencing... but a pouch provides none of that.
Here are the specifications of a Collection.

* `add()`
* `remove()`
* `size()`
* `contains()`
* `iterator()`: returns a Collection iterator
