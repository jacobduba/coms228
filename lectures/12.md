# Lecture 12

Starting with n elements, we shrink the # of elements under consideration by half every iteration!
The algorithm terminates when left > right, so the last iteration left = right...
we only have one element to consider.

Starting with n, n / 2 / 2 / 2 / 2 = 1 let us say this is k times divide-by-two.

n / (2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2) = 1

n / 2^k = 1

2^k = n

k = logn <-- that is a definition, lines 222 and 224 say the same thing.

Rule of thumb! Every time an iteration shaves of a fraction of the elements under consideration, that is a logn algorithm!!
The idea is FRACTIONS: 1/10th of elements, 1/100th of elements, 4% of elements...

If an iteraction advances the counter by a fixed # of steps, it is linear.

#### Example 3:
```java
void foo(n)
{

}
```

#### Example 3.1:
```java
for (int i = 1; i < n; i = i * 1.1) {} // Logarithmic
```

#### EXample 4: Subset sum

Input: An array A with n elements and a number K.

Question: Does A contain a submit of elements that adds up exactly to K?

E.g. target number is 117 using 2, 5, 13, 15, 19, 27, 35, 39

Solution: brute-force search

Adding each combination is in linear time O(n) because on average I will be adding n / 2 integers.

Each check therefore takes O(n). How many checks are there?

We can use bit string to keep track of combinations: n bits, each bit is 1 if number is in combination; o is number is not used.
```
2, 5, 13, 15, 19, 27, 35, 39

0  0  0   0   0   0   0   0     check by adding
0  0  0   0   0   0   0   1     check by adding
1  0  0   0   0   0   1   0     check by adding
......................1...1
0  0  0   0   0   0   1   1
```

Total # combinations:

2^8 because it is 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2

Big-O is therefor (2^n)*n = O(n*2^n) (exponential multiplied by linear)

We CANNOT solve this problem even for a 100 numbers.

#### Example 5
```java
public static void selectionSort(int[] arr) { // O(n) linear
	for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; ++i) {
		int minIndex = i;
		for (int j = i + 1; j < arr.length; ++j) { // O(n) linear
			if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
				minIndex = j;
			}
		}
		int temp = arr[i];
		arr[i] = arr[minIndex];
		arr[minIndex] = temp;
	}
}

// To use compareTo(), we implement Comparable<MyClass>:
// Implement comparable for objects with a natural order

public class MyClass implements Comparable<MyClass> {
	@Override
	public int compareTo(MyClass other) {
		// if this < other, return int < 0
		// if this > other, return int > 0
		// if this == other, return 0
	}
}
```

Nested linear loops means O(n*n) = O(n^2). Boom.
