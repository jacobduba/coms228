# Lecture 27 (queues)

## Queues

A list with access only at its front and rear.

Queues have:

* `enqueue()`
* `dequeue()`
* `front()`

Java has a `Queue<E>` interface that had the following functions:

* `front()`
    * `E element()` Retrieves, but does not remove the head of the queue.
    Throws `NoSuchElementException` if the query is empty.
    * `E peek()` Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue,
    or returns `null` if this queue is empty.
* `enqueue()`
    * `boolean add(E e)` Inserts e into this queue if it is possible to do so without
    violating capacity restrictions, returning `true` upon success and throwing an
    `IllegalStateException` if out of space.
    * `boolean offer(E e)` Inserts e into this queue if it is possible to do so without
    violating capacity restrictions.
* `dequeue()`
    * `E poll()` Retrieves and removes the head of this queue, or returns `null` if this queue is empty.
    * `E remove()` Retrieves and removes the head of this queue. Throws
    `NosuchElementException()` if this queue is empty.

Since `Queue<E>` extends `Collection<E>`, it inherits all of the latter's methods, including `isEmpty()`,
`size()`, and `iterator()`.

### Implementation of `enqueue()` w/h circular array

```java
public void enqueue() {
    if (last < first - 1) {
        arr[last] = data;
        last = (last + 1) % arr.length;
    }
}
```
