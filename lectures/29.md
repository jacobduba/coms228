## Expression Trees

### Construction

Expression trees are used by compilers.

We have a postfix expression and want to create a tree from it.

Scan the expression character by character from left to right. For each character C:

1. If c is blank, skip it.
2. If c is a digit, create a node for it and push it on the stack.
3. If c is an operator,
    1. Create node n for c.
    2. Pop it to the top of the stack
    3. Pop again, and make it n's left subtree

### Evaluation

Given a root node:

1. If the node is aleaf, return the value of the leaf.
2. Else, return evaluate(leftSubtree) op evaluate(rightSubtree)
