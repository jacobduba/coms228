# Lecture 39

**EXAM** No weighted graphs, but breadth-first and depth-first search.
Study backwards, starting from today's lecture.

## Depth-first search

Idea: *keep going forward* as long as there are unseen nodes to be visited.
Backtrack when stuck.

Color map & Predecessor:

* Green: v is undiscovered and unprocessed.
* Red: v is discovered and unprocessed.
* Black: v is discovered and processed.

Time complexity of O(V+E)

```
dfs(G):
    foreach node v in G
        color(v) = green
        pred(v) = null
    foreach node V in G
        if color(v) == green
            dfsVisit(G, v, color, pred)
    return pred

dfsVisit(G, u, color, pred):
    color(u) = red

    foreach neighbor v of u
         if color(v) == green
            pred(v) = u
            dfsVisit(G, v, color, pred)
        
    color(u) = black
```

Edges that, during DFS, lead to an unexplored vertex from a depth-first search forest.
The DFS forest can be constructed from the predecessor table.

## Edge Classification â€” Undirected Graphs

1. **Tree edges** are those in DFS forest.
2. **Back edges** go from a vertex to one of its ancestors.

Besides tree edges and back edges, there are also

3. Forward edges go from a vertex to one of its descendants.
4. Cross edges: all other edges.

If all the edges were undirected, forward and cross edges would be either tree or back edges.

## Detecting cycles

Fact: A directed graph G has a cycle if and only if its DFS forest has a black edge.

* A back edge leads to a cycle (adding an edge to the tree)
