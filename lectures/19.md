## Collections

`remove()` has an implicit parameter that is enabled by `next()`.
`next()` serves data items.
`remove()` ONLY deletes the last served item.

```
next() -- returns an Employee obj
remove() -- deletes the above from the collection
remove() -- throws IllegalStateException
```

Behind the scenes we have a cursor that is moving among the objects regardless of the internal structure.

If `remove()` could be repeated, then `remove()` could iterate through the collection.
Which would be a side effect for that method.
Side effects cause runtime errors because the programmer forgot they exist.

```java
public class FirstCollection ... {
	private class MyIterator ... {
		/**
		* Index of element to be returned by next().
		*/
		int cursor = 0;

		@Override
		public boolean hasNext() {
			return cursor < size;
		}

		@Override
		public E next() {
			if (cursor >= size) throw new NoSuchElementException();
			canRemove = true;
			E result = data[cursor];
			cursor++;
			return result;
		}

		@Override
		public void remove() {
			if (!canRemove) throw new IllegalStateException();				
			for (int i = cursor; i < size; ++i) {
				data[i - 1] = data[i];
			}
			// Null out the vacated cell to avoid memory leak
			data[size - 1] = null;
			--size;
			--cursor;
			canRemove = false;
		}
	}
}
```

Weaknesses of our ArrayCollection:

1) `remove()` takes forever.
2) `add()` can take a long time if checkCapacity() doubles the array.
3) If large array, many slots could be empty, wasting memory and energy.

We can remove the above problems by making a linked list collection, but the development cost is higher.

## Linked List

A linked list is made of nodes that at a minimum:

1) Contain a data item, and
2) Contain an address of another Node object.

Linked list example for CatDogBird:

```
["Cat"|DogAddress]-->["Dog"|BirdAdress]-->["Bird"|null]
```

A linked list is a linked sequence of Node objects that terminates with a null pointer.
Each node is a train car that links to other train cars.

Implementation of a LinkedList:

```java
public class LinkedList {
	Node head = null;

	private class Node {
		public Object data;
		public Node next;
		public Node(Object data) {
			this.data = data;
		}
	}
	...
}
```
